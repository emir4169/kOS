## What kOS Is:
kOS (short for "kevin's OS") pronounced as "chaos", is a lightweight operating system intended to provide absolute freedom while retaining ~some~ safety. It started out of a desire to create
a ring0 math library where the developer has absolute control over optimization/hardware.

## What kOS Is NOT:
kOS is technically ~not~ an operating system... yet. For now it's just a shitty, lightweight kernel with IRQ1 (keyboard) and syscalls barely impelemented.

## Contributing:
For now, I (kevin) have been the sole contributor but I'm very open to reviewing any PRs from the OS community, even if that is a pipe dream lol.

## Have fun, create chaos!
